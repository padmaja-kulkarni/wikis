Standard Procedure:

+Updating the urdf of the robot
 +=============================
 +
 +When you need to add parts to the robot (such as a camera, plate, fingers etc.) the urdf of the robot needs to be updated.
 +
 +The example here is to update the urdf to adjust the position/tilt of the Asus camera. You can follow similar steps for adjusting other parts as well.
 +
 +* Run mir_bringup on the robot
 +
 +		roslaunch mir_bringup robot.launch
 +* Open rviz and add the robot model and PointCloud2 from the Asus
 +* Move the arm if necessary, so that the arm is in view of the camera and it can be seen as a pointcloud
 +* Open the urdf file for the robot
 +
 +		 mas_industrial_robotics/blob/hydro/mir_robots/mir_hardware_config/youbot-brsu-2/urdf/robot.urdf.xacro
 +* Update the values for the `asus_xtion_camera` tag
 +* Run the following command to update the urdf in the robot model in rviz
 +
 +		roslaunch mir_hardware_config upload_param.launch; rosrun robot_state_publisher robot_state_publisher
 +* Repeat the previous two steps until the pointcloud of the arm (or other parts of the robot) match the robot model
 
 
 Magdeburg Hacks:
 since the arm is not visible with the camera, point the camera at the workspace and adjust the angle until the 
 workspace pointcloud is horizontal.
 Then run the pointcloud2laser.launch file 
 
 
 https://github.com/ros-perception/pointcloud_to_laserscan/blob/indigo-devel/launch/sample_node.launch
 
 move the camera urdf around until /scan_front and the laser scan readings from the camera match each other.
 
 one can also collect pointclouds as long as the workspace pointcloud is horizontal, and fix the x, y and yaw later
